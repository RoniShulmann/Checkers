# Checkers
Emphasis on implementing work with object-oriented departments and programming.
Realization of a "checkers" game when the console is the user interface.
The software allows two players to play against each other, and allows to play against the computer, when in such a situation the computer makes random decisions about its moves, from the selection of legal moves at its disposal.
 Each user in turn will be asked to select the slot they want to move from and the slot they want to move to. In the following format: COLrow> COLrow (e.g. Bf> Af.)
If the move is not a valid move, the user will receive an appropriate message, and will be prompted to enter a different move.
